# Project Title
We all know what an aircraft looks like from above, but do computers? This project aims to teach a computer what an aircraft looks like and further identify an aircraft in an image. When an aircraft is identified in an image, image segmentation tecniques are applied to the relevant image to seperate the aircraf fuselage.
